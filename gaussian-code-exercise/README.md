# Gaussian Code Exercise

Read through the code below and fill out the TODOs. You'll find a cell at the end
 of the Jupyter notebook containing unit tests. After you've run the code cell with 
 the Gaussian class, you can run the final cell to check that your code functions
 as expected.

For this exercise, you will use a file called 'numbers.txt', which is read in by th
read_data_file() method.
